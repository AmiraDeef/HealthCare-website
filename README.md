# Minimalistic Responsive Landing Page

This project is a frontend implementation of a professional UI design. I developed the code to transform a static design into a fully responsive web page using semantic HTML and custom CSS.

##  Built With
* **HTML5** - Semantic structure
* **CSS3** - Flexbox, and custom properties (variables)
* **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach

## Design Resource
The UI design for this project was provided by the Figma community:
* **Figma Design:** [Minimalistic Responsive Landing Pages](https://www.figma.com/design/SYYRHfHnH6UWZETPYLH0XS/Minimalistic-Responsive-Landing-Pages--Community-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=QWRQIblj0e2J1Bzj-0)
* *Note: I focused exclusively on the frontend development and code implementation of this design.*
